Coursework 1: Descriptive statistics and probability distributions
 
In this coursework, you will review the main statistics used to describe data - centrality, variance, quantiles, and skew - as well as review the properties of the different classes of probability distributions.

The coursework has 10 questions in total, each of them worth 1 mark:

- The first 2 questions relate to centrality metrics.

- Questions 3-4-5 relate to variance.

- Questions 6-7 relate to quantiles and skew.

- The last 3 questions relate to the properties of probability distributions.

You can have as many attempts as you want to answer each question. Only the last attempt will be used for grading. The quiz will close on the 15th of October 2017 at 23:59.

Good luck!
 
a) Centrality
 
Q1.1- Centrality: Consider the following centrality statistics: mode, mean, median and mid-range. Which one(s) best describes the centrality of a set of 10,000 points distributed according to a normal random variable? Help yourself by generating in R (using the rnorm() function) a set of 10,000 points distributed according to a normal random variable, and plotting the histogram using the hist() R command. To obtain the necessary statistics, just run the summary() command in R that returns the basic statistics of a set of points.

My Answer:
Median and mean, because they were much closer than other indexes to 0.

FEEDBACK
With so many points, it does not matter, all of them are more or less equivalent except the mid-range that is always relatively unstable.
 
Q1.2 - Centrality: Consider the following centrality statistics: mode, mean, median and mid-range. Which one(s) best describes the centrality of a set of 10 points distributed according to a normal random variable? Help yourself by generating in R (using the rnorm() function) a set of 10 points distributed according to a normal random variable, and plotting the histogram using the hist() R command.

My Answer:
Not enough data to make a meaningful decision.

FEEDBACK
With a limited number of points, the mode is unlikely to be meaningful at all. The mean will be biased but should be ok. The median is least biased so it is the best. The mid-range will also be very biased. So the best ones will be the median and optionally the mean.

b) Variance
 
Variance captures the average dispersion of a set of numbers around their average.
 
Q1.3 - Variance: What is the variance of a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1? Do not rely on R or data to answer this question.

My Answer:
Standard deviation is the square root of variance. Variance cannot be neganive as well. Taking this into account, variance is 1.

FEEDBACK
Since the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, the variance is also 1.
 
Q1.4 - Variance: Generate two set of points, one with 10 points distributed according to a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and the other with 1000 points distributed according to a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Which set of points has the higher variance?
 
My answer:
In my experiment the dataset with the big amount of data has a higher variance. But this indicates that in this exact experiment the data points are very spread out from the mean, and from one another. I also run other experiments, and the results vary.

FEEDBACK
In principle, the first one should have the higher variance, as sample variance decreases with sample size for a given distribution. However, when only one instance of different-sized samples are used, the larger sample will tend to more easily see a few higher values that bias the larger sample more, hence leads to the larger sample to have a lower variance.

Q1.5 - Variance: Assume that a set of points distributed according to a given distribution suffer from a few very large values (called outliers). In what way do such outliers affect the variance?

My answer:
The dispersion would be higher that it would be without these large values. Because the data points would be more spread out from the mean and from one another, than they should be.

FEEDBACK
Outliers in the form of very large values increase the variance.

c) Quantiles and skew

Quantiles sample specific values of a distribution, providing a summary of its "shape".

Q1.6 - Quantiles and skew (quartiles): Assuming that the data points we are considering are distributed according to a normal probability distribution (of unknown mean and variance), what is the relationship between the first and the third quartiles?

My answer:
The first quartile should be less than mean and the third quartile should be more than mean.

FEEDBACK
Their distance to the mean is equal since the distribution is symmetric.

Q1.7 - Quantiles and skew (skew): Skew captures the symmetry of a distribution around its mode (assuming there is a single mode). If a set of points have a positive skew, how are the mean and median related?

To help you, plot the histogram of a Poisson random variable with lambda = 4. Use the R command rpois(1000,4) to generate the Poisson distribution. Use the R package “e1071” to compute the skew using the skewness() function. Also, check the skew of the generated points distributed according to a Poisson with the skew of the previously generated points according to a Normal distribution. In the case of Normal distribution, the skew is expected to be very close to 0.

My answer:
In my first experiment, the median and the mean were very close to each other, but the mean value was slightly higher that the median value. Running more similar experiments, I understood that results may vary. The skew for the Normal distribution is very close to 0.

FEEDBACK
If the distribution has a positive skew, this means that there are more large values on the right of the mode. The large values will bias the mean, making it larger than the median.

d) Properties of probability distributions
 
During the lectures, we have studied 3 classes of probability distributions: exponential, extreme value, and heavy-tailed.
 
Q1.8 - Properties of probability distributions (exponential) : Exponential distributions, such as the normal, Poisson, and binomial, are characterised by a very fast (exponentially) decreasing density around their mode. How are the standard deviation and the percentiles 25/75 related?Hint: If you cannot think of a direct answer, use the mode/median as a point of reference.

My answer:
Q1  (25% percentile) = mean - 2*standard_deviation
Q3  (75% percentile) = mean + 2*standard_deviation 
According to the definition

FEEDBACK
Percentiles 25/75 cannot be far away from the mode/median. The direct way to answer is that the percentiles 25/75 are a few standard deviations away from the median. Another way to answer is that the difference between the percentiles 25/75 and the mode/median will also be or the same order of magnitude as the standard deviation.
 
Q1.9 - Properties of probability distributions (extreme value) : Extreme value distributions, as their name indicates, have a much higher probability of large values to occur, despite still being technically exponential distributions. Which part of the density (expressed as percentiles) of these distributions characterises them best? Hint: Think of what makes these distributions different from exponential distributions, and therefore what percentiles must significantly differ.

My answer:
95% - 98% percentile of the extreme value distribution should be appropriate for dividing them from others.

FEEDBACK
The very low/high percentiles characterise them best, since their peculiarity is their extreme values.
 
Q1.10 - Properties of probability distributions (heavy-tailed) : Heavy-tailed distributions are particularly peculiar. Indeed, these distributions have extremely large (or small) values, so large that some statistics are highly biased. What is the relationship between the median and the mean for such distributions?

My answer:
Mean should be always much more higher than the mean, because the mean would be moved to the side of the highest values in the dataset. Despite there are not so many large values, the are extremely high, so the median would reflect the rest part of the dataset whist has small values of the observations.

FEEDBACK
The mean will be quite far away from the median, often to such an extent that the mean will not be a meaningful centrality metric. The reason is that the mean is easily biased by extreme values.
